# Day 2 - Student Management System

This folder contains Java programs for managing student information as part of the Elevate Labs internship.

## Files

- `Student.java`  
  Defines a `Student` class with fields for student ID, name, and marks. Includes constructors, getters, and setters for encapsulation.

- `StudentManagementSystem.java`  
  Provides a simple management system to add, display, and manage student records using the `Student` class. Typically includes a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Features

- Create and store student records (ID, name, marks)
- View all student details
- Update student information
- Delete student records (if implemented)
- Menu-driven console interface

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:
    ```
    javac task2/Student.java task2/StudentManagementSystem.java
    ```
2. Run the management system:
    ```
    java task2.StudentManagementSystem
    ```

## Example Usage

```

1. Add Student
2. View Students

## Note
- I wrote each class in a separate file (`Student.java` and `StudentManagementSystem.java`) and also included an alternative version where all classes are in a single file (`StudentManagementSystem2.java`).
- For more information, please refer to those files.
